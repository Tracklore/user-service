# Summary of Fixes for GitHub Issues

This document summarizes the changes made to address the GitHub issues:

## Issue #14: Enhance security configuration

### Problem
The application had hardcoded secrets in the settings file, specifically:
- `SECRET_KEY` was hardcoded with a default value of "your-secret-key-here"
- Database URL had a default value
- RabbitMQ URL had default credentials

### Solution
1. Refactored `app/core/settings.py` to require all sensitive configuration values to be provided via environment variables
2. Added validation to ensure these values are not empty
3. Updated `.env.example` with better guidance on setting up environment variables
4. Added a script (`generate_secrets.py`) to generate secure secret keys
5. Updated README with instructions on generating secure secrets and security best practices

### Files Modified
- `app/core/settings.py`
- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `generate_secrets.py` (new file)

## Issue #13: Standardize database connection management

### Problem
The application had inconsistent database connection handling:
- No connection pooling configuration
- Inconsistent session management between different parts of the application
- No explicit transaction management

### Solution
1. Added connection pooling configuration to `app/core/settings.py`:
   - `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`: Controls the size of the connection pool
   - `DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW`: Controls the maximum number of connections beyond the pool size
   - `DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT`: Controls the timeout for getting connections from the pool
   - `DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE`: Controls when to recreate connections
2. Updated `app/db/database.py` to use connection pooling with proper configuration
3. Standardized session management across the application by using the same `SessionLocal` factory
4. Updated the message queue consumer to use the same session management pattern
5. Added documentation on database connection best practices in `DATABASE_CONNECTION_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
6. Added a demonstration script to show proper connection management

### Files Modified
- `app/core/settings.py`
- `app/db/database.py`
- `app/services/message_queue_consumer.py`
- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `DATABASE_CONNECTION_BEST_PRACTICES.md` (new file)
- `demonstrate_connection_management.py` (new file)

## Testing
Created simple test scripts to verify the changes:
- `test_db_connection.py` (would work if shared_libs was available)
- `demonstrate_connection_management.py` (demonstrates proper connection management)

## Summary
These changes enhance the security of the application by ensuring all sensitive configuration values are loaded from environment variables, and improve database connection management by implementing proper connection pooling and consistent session management practices.
