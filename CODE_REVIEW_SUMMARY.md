# User Service Code Review Summary

## Overview
I've completed a comprehensive review of the user-service codebase, identifying 12 issues ranging from critical security vulnerabilities to low-priority improvements. All issues have been documented in the `ISSUES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md` file and corresponding GitHub issues have been created with appropriate labels.

## Issues Addressed
All 12 issues have been successfully fixed and closed:

1. **Critical Security Vulnerability**: Hardcoded authentication token in `app/services/user.py` (Labels: security, critical) - **FIXED**
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Mixed usage of integer status codes and enum values (Labels: bug, high) - **FIXED**
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling in message queue consumer (Labels: bug, high) - **FIXED**
4. **Duplicate Logic**: Business logic duplicated between API routes and service layer (Labels: refactoring, high) - **FIXED**
5. **Schema Inconsistency**: Inconsistent field definitions in badge schema (Labels: bug, high) - **FIXED**
6. **Missing Input Validation**: Lack of proper input validation on API endpoints (Labels: enhancement, medium) - **FIXED**
7. **Inefficient Database Queries**: Suboptimal database query implementation (Labels: enhancement, medium) - **FIXED**
8. **Missing Unit Tests**: Insufficient test coverage for core functionality (Labels: testing, medium) - **FIXED**
9. **Async/Await Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent usage of asynchronous patterns (Labels: bug, medium) - **FIXED**
10. **Missing API Documentation**: Lack of comprehensive API documentation (Labels: documentation, low) - **FIXED**
11. **Configuration Management**: Room for improvement in settings configuration (Labels: enhancement, low) - **FIXED**
12. **Logging Improvements**: Use of print statements instead of proper logging (Labels: enhancement, low) - **FIXED**

## Labels Created
- `security` - Security related issues
- `critical` - Critical priority issues
- `high` - High priority issues
- `medium` - Medium priority issues
- `low` - Low priority issues
- `refactoring` - Code refactoring needed
- `testing` - Testing related issues

## Summary of Changes Made
